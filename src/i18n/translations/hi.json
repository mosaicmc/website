Delivering enduring positive impact for people and planet is the most important task of leadership, and how I measure my career highlights. My leadership career of over 25 years includes roles as a CEO in rural‑remote local government in two states, living with First Nations communities in the beautiful Australian outback. This followed volunteering with an education not‑for‑profit in rural Tanzania, an experience that changed my career focus. Outside of work, I am a Rotarian and remain a passionate supporter of the education program in Tanzania. I love being outdoors horse‑riding, kayaking and camping with my family including three sons and six grandchildren."

      "whichProgramAnswer": "It depends on what you need right now. If you're facing specific parenting challenges, family stress, or need help accessing services, CAFS's professional family support is ideal. If you have young children (0-6) and want community connection with cultural celebration, PAW playgroups are perfect. Many families use both programs at different times. Call us and we'll help you decide what fits best. Our staff can assess your needs and recommend the most appropriate support pathway.",
      "freeQuestion": "Are both programs really free?",
      "freeAnswer": "Yes, completely free. CAFS family support is funded by NSW Department of Communities and Justice. PAW playgroups are funded through government grants and community support. This includes individual casework, parenting workshops, cultural playgroup sessions, professional interpreters, materials, and morning tea. There are no hidden costs or fees for any family support services. Government funding agreements ensure ongoing free access for all eligible multicultural families.",
      "languageQuestion": "Can I access help if I don't speak much English?",
      "languageAnswer": "Absolutely - language is never a barrier. We provide professional interpreters through government-approved services for all programs. Many staff speak multiple languages and represent diverse cultural backgrounds. PAW sessions encourage families to use their home language, and CAFS workers can arrange interpreter support for all meetings and workshops. We respect and celebrate multilingual families. Professional interpreter services meet government quality standards and are available in all required languages.",
      "startQuestion": "How do I start accessing family support?",
      "startAnswer": "Multiple easy ways to begin: Call our main number (02) 4960 8400 for CAFS family support or (02) 4334 3877 for PAW playgroups. You can self-refer or ask teachers, doctors, or community workers to refer your family. For PAW, just drop in to any session - no registration needed before your first visit. We'll connect you with the right support quickly. Same-day response for urgent family support needs and immediate access to community playgroup sessions.",
      "referralsQuestion": "Can professionals refer families to your programs?",
      "referralsAnswer": "Yes, we welcome professional referrals for both programs. Teachers, social workers, doctors, community workers, and other service providers can refer families to CAFS or PAW programs. We always get family consent before accepting referrals and keep referring professionals updated with family permission. We can provide joint case management for complex situations through CAFS. Professional collaboration follows Australian Privacy Principles and helps ensure families get comprehensive support.",
      "availabilityQuestion": "Where are your family support programs available?",
      "availabilityAnswer": "CAFS family support: Available across Newcastle, Hunter region, with outreach to Central Coast families. We offer home visits, office appointments, and phone/video support. PAW playgroups: Central Coast locations including Blue Haven (Tuesdays), The Entrance (Thursdays), and Watanobbi (Fridays).
