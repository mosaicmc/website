# Service Pages QA Checklist

- Page structure follows: Hero → Eligibility → Process/How it works → Programs → Impact → Team → FAQs → Contact CTA → Related Services
- Program cards use: icon tile + h3 title + one description paragraph + “What We Provide” (4 bullets)
- Eligibility centralized in section (no duplicated in‑card eligibility)
- CTAs located at section/page level; cards avoid CTAs unless baseline requires
- Brand tokens applied consistently (accent color per page) for icon tile, bullets, rings
- Typography consistent (section `h2`, card `h3`, base text ≥16px); spacing rhythm aligned
- Language tone: clear, supportive, culturally respectful; avoids jargon and long dashes
- Accessibility: visible focus rings (`focus:ring-2` + accent + offset), sufficient contrast, icons with text, semantic headings and lists, meaningful `alt` text
- Mobile responsiveness: grids collapse cleanly; spacing maintains readability; images scale
- Content density: one concise description paragraph per card; exactly 4 concise bullets
- Consistency: shared labels (“What We Provide”, “Impact stories”, “Who Can Get Involved?”), standard terminology
 - Terminology: use “Home Care” (not “Aged Care”) across UI, metadata, alt text
