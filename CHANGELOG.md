# Changelog

## 2025-12-12

### Removed
- Breadcrumbs UI component and rendering across all routes (`src/App.tsx:60`)
- Breadcrumb JSON-LD generation and injection (`src/components/SEO.tsx:56–76,100`)

### Notes
- Component file kept returning `null` to avoid accidental usage (`src/components/ui/Breadcrumbs.tsx:1`)
- Breadcrumbs redesign will be implemented later; removed now to avoid UI clutter and stale SEO markup

- Standardized team avatar display size via `avatarSize=128` in `team-05` component usage.

### Added
- Implemented Playwright UI test suite `tests/ui/home-about.spec.ts`:
  - Validates Home Google Reviews section rendering and interactions (load more).
  - Visual snapshots for Home Google Reviews: mobile, tablet, desktop.
  - Validates About Values grid (4 cards) and Leadership grid (3 cards with Avatars).
  - Visual snapshots for About Leadership: mobile, tablet, desktop.
- Scoped Playwright config to UI specs only (`playwright.config.ts`):
  - `testDir: './tests/ui'`
  - `testMatch: /.*\\.spec\\.ts/`
  - Ensures Vitest unit tests do not run under Playwright.
- QA report added at `QA/QA-Report.md` with results and screenshot locations.

### Changed
- Confirmed Home page integrates `GoogleReviews` with accessible selectors, and About page redesigned using ShadCN `Card` and `Avatar` components for Values and Leadership.

### Notes
- Breakpoint screenshots generated under `tests/ui/home-about.spec.ts-snapshots/` for all three browsers.
- Preview servers available at `http://localhost:4173/` and `http://localhost:4174/` during validation.
